# Changelog — Skybound Trials

## [v0.2.1] — Unity 6 LTS target + v0.2 doc alignment

### Changed
- Engine target bumped from Unity 2022.3 LTS → **Unity 6 LTS (6000.4.4f1)**.
- URP from 14.x → 17.x; Cinemachine references updated to 3.x (`CinemachineCamera + CinemachineThirdPersonFollow`).
- `docs/04_TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md` rewritten to drop residual v0.1 references to `ClaudeCopilotService` / `AICopilotPersonaSO`; new §7 "Unity 6 compatibility notes"; Coach section now references LineBank-driven design.
- `docs/07_UNITY_SETUP_GUIDE.md` rewritten to v0.2 (no AI proxy / API-key steps; LineBank authoring step); Unity 6 project flow + Cinemachine 3 step.
- `README.md` Engine row + status table.

No gameplay code changes — v0.2 C# is fully forward-compatible with Unity 6.

## [v0.2-mission1-no-runtime-ai] — Removed runtime LLM dependencies

### Changed
- **Critic & Review Board re-review (Cycle 4):** AI is now a development-workflow tool,
  not a runtime gameplay feature. The shipping game no longer calls any LLM at runtime.
- `CoachAI.cs` renamed to `Coach.cs`, rewritten to pick from 6× LineBankSO pools.
- `GameBootstrap.cs` registers `IScriptedDialogueService` instead of `IAICopilotService`.
- `docs/05_AI_COPILOT_INTEGRATION.md` replaced with `docs/05_AI_ASSISTED_DEVELOPMENT.md`.
- README updated to drop runtime-AI claims.

### Removed
- `Assets/_Project/Scripts/AI/` (ClaudeCopilotService, AICopilotPersonaSO)
- `Assets/_Project/Scripts/Gameplay/Coach/CoachAI.cs` (replaced by Coach.cs)
- `server/copilot-proxy/` (Node proxy)
